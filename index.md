# Overview

This wiki provides a guide for the users of the MRC Epidemiology Secure Research Computing Platform (SRCP).

SRCP is a platform provided by the University of Cambridge [Research Computing Service](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/srcp/index.html). It allows researchers to access valuable datasets for research, similar to a secure reference library. Rather than extracts of individual level data being ‘released,’ SRCP provides access to a secure analytics environment so researchers bring analysis to the data. Results are vetted before being removed from the platform.

SRCP has standard analysis software such as R and Python available, along with tools for more specialist 'omics analyses. There is scope to add new software that is not currently available, which is assessed on a case by case basis.

SRCP has some similarities to the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) system (also known as the High Performance Computer or HPC) and therefore it can be helpful to refer to the [documentation](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/index.html) for this system too.
